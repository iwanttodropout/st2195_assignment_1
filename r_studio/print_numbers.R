# Program to print all integers between 1 and 10 (including 1 and 10) to screen

cat(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)

#Method 2: print numbers 1 to 10
print (1:10)

#Method 3: print numbers 1 to 10 using a "for" loop

  print(x)
  print("------")
}

for (x in c(1:10)) {
  print(x)
}

for (x in c(1:10)) {
  cat(x, " ")

#Method 4: print numbers 1 to 10 using a "while loop"

x <- 1
while (x <= 10) {
  print (x)
